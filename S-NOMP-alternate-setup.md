# S-NOMP for Verus, alternate setup

This alternate setup deviates from the standard setup on the following subjects:
 - It installs and uses `keydb` as replacement for `redis`. `Keydb` is a faster and less memory intensive database, fully compatible with `redis`.
 - It prepares the `keydb` database for use with additional stratum servers.
 - It simplifies the Verus Daemon installation process by using an install script from https://github.com/Oink70/Verus-CLI-tools.
 - Mentions `blocknotify.c` code to be compiled and used as alternative for the standard `api.js`.
 - it includes `UFW firewall` instructions.

Operating a mining pool requires you to know about systems administration, IT security, databases, software development, coin daemons and other more or less related stuff. Running a production pool can literally be more work than a full-time job.

**NOTE:** When you are done please message `englal#8861` on the [Verus discord](https://discord.gg/VRKMP2S)) with your poolwallet IP so he can `addnode` it around his platform, which contributes to network stability. `Done` in this case means at least full setup procedure completed, pool running, a block was found and paid out. Thank you.

A VPS with 8GB of RAM, anything above 30GB **SSD** storage and 1 CPU core which knows about AES-NI is the absolute minimum requirement. Generally, having more RAM is more important than having more CPU power here. Additionally, the hypervisor of your VPS _must_ pass through the original CPU designation from its host. See below for an example that will likely lead to trouble.

```bash
lscpu|grep -i "model name"
Model name:            QEMU Virtual CPU version 2.5+
```

Basically, anything in there that is not a real CPU name _may_ cause NodeJS to behave funny despite the `Virtual CPU` having all necessary CPU flags. Be aware and ready to switch servers and/or hosting companies if need be. Start following the guide while logged in as `root`.


## Operating System

This guide is tailored to and tested on `Debian 11 "Bullseye"` but should probably also work on Debian-ish derivatives like `Devuan` or `Ubuntu` and others. Before starting, please install the latest updates and prerequisites.

```bash
echo "deb https://download.keydb.dev/open-source-dist $(lsb_release -sc) main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/keydb.list
wget -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/keydb.gpg https://download.keydb.dev/open-source-dist/keyring.gpg
apt update
apt -y upgrade
apt -y install libgomp1 keydb git libboost-all-dev libsodium-dev build-essential
```

## Poolwallet

Create a user for the poolwallet, switch to that account:

```bash
useradd -m -d /home/verus -s /bin/bash verus
su - verus
```

Download the **latest** Verus binaries from the [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases) and install them like so:

```bash
mkdir ~/bin
cd ~/bin
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oink70/Verus-CLI-tools/main/auto-verus.sh
chmod +x auto-verus.sh
./auto-verus.sh
```
When the script asks if this is a new installation, answer with `Y` (default). On `Enter blockchain data directory or leave blank for default:` press enter. On the question to install, answered with `1` (default).
If you installed the updates and prerequisites, the daemon will start in the background.
Check if it indeed started using `tail -f ~/.komodo/VRSC/debug.log` (`CTRL-C` to exit).

Now, let's create the wallet export directory.

```bash
mkdir ~/export
```

It's time to do the wallet config. A reasonably secure `rpcpassword` can be generated using this command:   

```bash
cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1
```

Edit `~/.komodo/VRSC/VRSC.conf` and include the parameters listed below, adapt the ones that need adaption.

```conf

# EOF
```

Afterwards, restart the verus daemon and let it sync the rest of the blockchain. We'll also watch the debug log for a moment:

```bash
cd ~/.komodo/VRSC; verusd -daemon 1>/dev/null 2>&1; sleep 1; tail -f debug.log
```

Press `ctrl-c` to exit `tail` if it looks alright. To check the status and know when the initial sync has been completed, issue

```bash
verus getinfo
```

When it has synced up to height, the `blocks` and `longestchain` values will be at par. Additionally, you should verify against [the explorer](https://explorer.veruscoin.io) that you are not on a fork. Edit the `crontab` using `crontab -e` and include the line below to autostart the poolwallet:

```crontab
@reboot cd /home/verus/.komodo/VRSC; /home/verus/bin/verusd -daemon 1>/dev/null 2>&1
```
**HINT:** if you can't stand `vi`, do `EDITOR=nano crontab -e` ;-)

Create a `start-daemon` script:
```bash
cat << EOX >> /home/verus/bin/start-daemon
#!/bin/bash
cd /home/verus/.komodo/VRSC; /home/verus/bin/verusd -daemon 1>/dev/null 2>&1
# EOF
EOX
chmod +x /home/verus/bin/start-daemon
```
create a restart script `/home/verus/bin/restart-daemon`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

#Copyright Alex English April 2021
#This script comes with no warranty whatsoever. Use at your own risk.

#This script just blocks execution until verusd exits. Use it for performing actions in a script after intentionally stopping verusd, or use for alarming if verusd fails, etc.
#If there are multiple instances of verusd running, this will not detect any of them going down, it will only exit when there are NO running instances of verusd

#passing any argument will make it run in verbose mode, telling you each time it checks

/home/verus/bin/verus stop

while ps -u "verus" x | grep "/home/verus/bin/verusd" | grep -v "grep"; do
    sleep 2s
done

count=$(/home/verus/bin/verus getconnectioncount)
case $count in
    ''|*[!0-9]*) dstat=0 ;;
    *) dstat=1 ;;
esac
if [[ "$dstat" == "0" ]]; then
        cd /home/verus/.komodo/VRSC && /home/verus/bin/verusd -daemon 1>/dev/null 2>&1
fi
#EOF
```
and make it an executable:
```bash
chmod +x /home/verus/bin/restart-daemon
```


## Keydb

Switch back to the `root` account by typing `exit` or hitting `ctrl-d`. In your `/etc/keydb/keydb.conf` file, make sure it contains this (and none of it is commented out):

```conf
bind * -::*
protected-mode no
port 6379
unixsocket /var/run/keydb/keydb.sock
unixsocketperm 775
appendonly yes
```

Set amount of connections to 1024 (or 65535 if you think you need it) instead of the standard 128:

```bash
echo 'net.core.somaxconn = 1024' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
```
And use the following command to activate it immediately
```bash
sysctl net.core.somaxconn=1024
```
**NOTE:** Be aware that you may have to install the POSIX module for numbers above 1024 (as pool user in the `~/s-nomp` directory: `npm install posix`). Check the pool log as soon as you start up. It will tell you if you need it.


Set the overcommit_memory feature to 1, to avoid loss of data in case of not enough memory:
```bash
echo 'vm.overcommit_memory = 1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
```
And use the following command to activate it immediately
```bash
sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1
```

Finally disable Transparent Huge Page:
```bash
nano /etc/default/grub.d/no_thp.cfg
```
add this to the empty file:
```conf
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="$GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT transparent_hugepage=never"
```
Update `GRUB` and reboot.
```bash
update-grub
reboot now
```

Wait for the reboot to finish and log back in as `root`. Set `keydb-server` to start at bootup and start it manually:

```bash
systemctl enable keydb-server
systemctl start keydb-server
```

## Node.js

Create a new user account to run the pool from. Switch to that user to setup `nvm.sh`:


```bash
useradd -m -d /home/pool -s /bin/bash pool
usermod -g pool redis
chown -R redis:pool /var/run/redis
su - pool
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

Log out and back in to activate `nvm.sh`

```bash
exit
su - pool
```

Now, install `NodeJS v10` via `nvm.sh` as well as `redis-commander` and [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io) via `npm`.   
**NOTE:** Node v11 or higher won't work. You _will_ have to use Node v10!
**NOTE:** PM2 v5.0.0 or higher won't work. You _will_ have to use PM2 v4.5.6!

```bash
nvm install 10
npm install -g pm2@4.5.6
```

Because `nvm.sh` comes without it, we need to add one symlink into its bindir for our installed NodeJS.

```bash
which node
/home/pool/.nvm/versions/node/v10.24.1/bin/node
```

Change to the resulting directory and create a symlink like below.

```bash
cd /home/pool/.nvm/versions/node/v10.24.1/bin
ln -s node nodejs
exit
```

## S-NOMP

Make sure you're in the `pool` account and clone the S-NOMP from our main repository:

```bash
su - pool
git clone https://github.com/veruscoin/s-nomp
cd s-nomp
```

Next, install all dependencies using `npm`:

```bash
npm ci
```

## Configuration Instructions

Shielding is no longer required for mined Verus coins. We will need two public addresses for this. Switch to the `verus` user and generate the addresses:

```bash
verus getnewaddress
verus getnewaddress
```

Next, we will dump the private keys of these addresses for safety reasons. For the transparent addresses, use

```bash
verus dumpprivkey <Verus T-Address 1>
verus dumpprivkey <Verus T-address 2>
```

**Save the data in an offline location, not on your computer!**

Now, switch to the `pool` account. First, copy `/home/pool/s-nomp/config_example.json` to `/home/pool/s-nomp/config.json`. Edit it to reflect the changes listed below.

  * Set both `host` and `stratumHost` to the external IP or DNS name of your server.
  * Enable UNIX socket connections by setting `"socket": "/var/run/keydb/keydb.sock",`, `"password": ""` and removing the rest of the lines in the `"redis"` sections. **Do NOT rename the `redis` section names themselvews!!!**

Now create a pool config. Copy `/home/pool/s-nomp/pool_configs/examples/vrsc.json` to `/home/pool/s-nomp/pool_configs/verus.json`. Edit it to reflect the changes listed below.

 * Set `enabled` to `true`.
 * Set `coin` to `vrsc.json`.
 * Set `address` to the first public address generated before.
 * Set `tAddress` to the second public address generated before.
 * Set `rewardRecipients` to your fee address and fee percentage. Remove `"": 0.2` if you want 0% fee.
 * Set `paymentInterval` to `180`
 * Set `minimumPayment` to `2`.
 * Set `maxBlocksPerPayment` to `8`.
 * Both `rewardRecipients` and `invalidAddress` are set to a Verus Foundation address per default, should you like to keep them intact.
 * **Otherwise make sure you do not use an address from the poolwallet for either `rewardRecipients` or `invalidAddress`**
 * Set `paymentInterval` (in Seconds) and `minimumPayment` (in VRSC) according to your planned scenario.
 * There are 2 occurences of `user`, `password` and `port` each. Use the `rpcuser`, `rpcpassword` and `rpcport` values from `/home/verus/.komodo/VRSC/VRSC.conf`.
 * Set `diff` to `131072`.
 * Set `minDiff` to `16384`.
 * Set `maxDiff` to `2147483648`

Edit the file `~/s-nomp/coins/vrsc.json` to reflect the following setting:
 * make sure `"requireShielding":false,` is set.

We are almost done now. Using the command mentioned at the beginning of this document, check if the blockchain has finished syncing. If not, wait for it to complete before continuing.

Now switch to the `verus` user, stop the wallet once more.

```bash
verus stop
```

To determine the location of your `node` binary, switch to user `pool`, do this and record your result. We'll need it for the next step.

```bash
which node
/home/pool/.nvm/versions/node/v8.17.0/bin/node
```

Switch back to user `verus` and edit `~/.komodo/VRSC/VRSC.conf` to enable the blocknotify command as seen below, using the location you just got from using `which node` before:

```conf
blocknotify=/home/pool/.nvm/versions/node/v10.24.1/bin/node /home/pool/s-nomp/scripts/cli.js blocknotify verus %s
```
also change in this setting (remove the `#` that is in front of it!!!), to reflect your own dee address and mining address you used in the s-Nomp config with their respective percentages:
```conf
miningdistribution={"FEE-ADDRESS":0.05,"<MINING-ADDRESS>":0.95}
```

*Alternative to running the blocknotify script through node*:
Compile (on any other machine) the `/home/pool/s-nomp/scripts/blocknotify.c` code, copy the binary to `/home/pool/s-nomp/scripts/blocknotify`, make executable using `chmod +x /home/pool/s-nomp/scripts/blocknotify` and use this line in your `VRSC.conf`:
```conf
blocknotify=/home/pool/s-nomp/scripts/blocknotify 127.0.0.1:17117 verus %s
```
This configuration will shave of milliseconds off the time it takes your pool to be notified.

Restart the wallet using the command already listed above. If you are not using `STDOUT`/`STDERR`-redirection, you will see errors about blocknotify. These are expected, because the pool is not running yet and thus the blocknotify script cannot complete successfully.


Switch to the `pool` user. Then start the pool using `pm2`:

```bash
cd ~/s-nomp
pm2 start init.js --name pool
```

Use `pm2 log` to check for S-NOMP startup errors.

If you completed all steps correctly, the web dashboard on your pool can be reached via port `8080` on the external IP or the DNS name of your server.

### S-Nomp Autostart

Edit your crontab using `crontab -e` and shove in this line at the bottom:

```crontab
@reboot /bin/sleep 300 && cd /home/pool/s-nomp && /home/pool/.nvm/versions/node/v8.17.0/bin/pm2 start init.js --name pool
```

**HINT:** if you can't stand `vi`, do `EDITOR=nano crontab -e` ;-)


## Further considerations

None of the topics below is strictly necessary, but most of them are recommended.

### Enabling firewall

As `root` user:
```bash
ufw allow from any to any port 22 comment "SSH access"
```
If you want to limit the IPs that can access your server over SSH (eg, if you have a fixed IP address or use a SSH-jump server) replace the first `any` with the IP or ip-range. doublecheck this or you will lock yourself out!
```bash
ufw allow from any to any port 80,443 comment "Standard web ports"
ufw allow from any to any port 9999 comment "mining port(s)"
```
add multiple mining ports by separating them by commas, analogue to the web ports.
```bash
ufw enable
```
If you are also installing a separate `stratum server`, it will need a connection to the `keydb` database:
```bash
ufw allow from <stratum-ip> to any port 6379 comment "Stratum server database connection"
```

### Useful DNS resolvers

Empty your `/etc/resolv.conf` and replace it with this:

```conf
# google, https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using
nameserver 8.8.4.4
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 2001:4860:4860::8844

# see 'man 5 resolv.conf'
options rotate timeout:1 attempts:5
```


### Improving SSH security

If you remember the good old `rand=4; // chosen by fair dice roll` comic, you're probably doing this anyways. If you don't, go Google the comic, you might have missed a laugh there!

As `root`, generate a proper `/etc/ssh/moduli` like this:

```bash
ssh-keygen -G "/root/moduli.candidates" -b 4096
mv /etc/ssh/moduli /etc/ssh/moduli.old
ssh-keygen -T /etc/ssh/moduli -f "/root/module.candidates"
rm "/root/moduli.candidates"
```

Add the recommended changes from [CiperLi.st](https://cipherli.st) to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, also make sure that `PermitRootLogin` is at least set to `without-password`. Then remove and re-generate your host keys like this:

```bash
cd /etc/ssh
rm ssh_host_*key*
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ssh_host_ed25519_key < /dev/null
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ssh_host_rsa_key < /dev/null
```

To finish, restart the ssh server:

```bash
/etc/init.d/sshd restart
```

### Reverse-proxying S-NOMP behind `nginx`

As `root`, install `nginx` and enable it on boot using these commands:

```bash
apt -y install nginx
systemctl enable nginx
```

Create `/etc/nginx/blockuseragents.rules` with these contents:

```conf
map $http_user_agent $blockedagent {
default         0;
~*malicious     1;
~*bot           1;
~*backdoor      1;
~*crawler       1;
~*bandit        1;
}
```

Edit `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default` to look like this:

```conf
include /etc/nginx/blockuseragents.rules;
server {
	if ($blockedagent) {
		return 403;
	}
	if ($request_method !~ ^(GET|HEAD)$) {
		return 444;
	}

	listen 80 default_server;
	listen [::]:80 default_server;
	charset utf-8;
	root /var/www/html;
	index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

	location / {
		proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;
		proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
	}

	location /admin {
		rewrite ^/.* /stats permanent;
	}

}
```

Restart `nginx`:

```bash
systemctl restart nginx
```

Switch to the `pool` user, edit `/home/pool/s-nomp/config.json` to bind the web interface to `127.0.0.1:8080`:

```conf
[...]
"website": {
    "enabled": true,
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 8080,
[...]

```

Restart the pool:

```bash
pm2 restart veruspool
```

If you've followed the above steps correctly, your pool's webdashboard is now proxied behind nginx.

### Disable unused webdashboard pages

Change to the `pool` account. Edit `/home/pool/s-nomp/libs/website.js` to have the `pageFiles` array look like below:

```conf
var pageFiles = {
    'index.html': 'index',
    'home.html': '',
    'manual.html': 'manual',
    'stats.html': 'stats',
    'tbs.html': 'tbs',
    'workers.html': 'workers',
    'api.html': 'api',
    'miner_stats.html': 'miner_stats',
    'payments.html': 'payments'
}
```

### Link to the `payments` page

Change to the `pool` user account. Edit `/home/pool/s-nomp/website/index.html` to include a new link at the right position, which is somewhere in between lines `30-70`:

```html
<header>
[...]
    <li class="{{? it.selected === 'payments' }}pure-menu-selected{{?}}">
        <a class="hot-swapper" href="/payments">
            <i class="fa fa-usd"></i>&nbsp;
            Payments
        </a>
    </li>
[...]
</header>
```

### Enable `logrotate`

As `root` user, create a file called `/etc/logrotate.d/pool` with these contents:

```conf
/home/verus/.komodo/VRSC/debug.log
/home/pool/.pm2/logs/pool-out.log
/home/pool/.pm2/logs/pool-error.log
{
  rotate 14
  daily
  compress
  delaycompress
  copytruncate
  missingok
  notifempty
}
```

### Increase open files limit

Add this to your `/etc/security/limits.conf`:

```conf
* soft nofile 1048576
* hard nofile 1048576
```

Reboot to activate the changes. Alternatively you can make sure all running processes are restarted from within a shell that has been launched _after_ the above changes were put in place, which usually is a huge pain. Just reboot.


### Networking optimizations

If your pool is expected to receive a lot of load, consider implementing below changes, all as `root`:

Enable the `tcp_bbr` kernel module:

```bash
modprobe tcp_bbr
echo tcp_bbr >> /etc/modules
```

Edit your `/etc/sysctl.conf` to include below settings:

```conf
net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control=bbr
net.core.rmem_default = 1048576
net.core.wmem_default = 1048576
net.core.rmem_max = 16777216
net.core.wmem_max = 16777216
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 87380 16777216
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 65536 16777216
net.ipv4.udp_rmem_min = 16384
net.ipv4.udp_wmem_min = 16384
net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 262144
net.ipv4.tcp_max_orphans = 262144
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 262144
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_max_tw_buckets = 2000000
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 16001 65530
net.core.somaxconn = 20480
net.ipv4.tcp_low_latency = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle = 0
net.ipv4.tcp_mtu_probing = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen = 3
net.ipv4.tcp_limit_output_bytes = 131072
```

Run below command to activate the changes, alternatively reboot the machine:


```bash
sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf

### Change swapping behaviour

If your system has a lot of RAM, you can change the swapping behaviour to only swap when necessary. Edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` to include this setting:

```conf
vm.swappiness=1
```

The range is `1-100`. The *lower* the number, the *later* the system will start swapping stuff out. Run below command to activate the change, alternatively reboot the machine:

```bash
sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf
```

### Install `molly-guard`

As a last sanity check before reboots, `molly-guard` will prompt you for the hostname of the system you're about to reboot. Install it like this:

```bash
apt -y install molly-guard
```

Check `/etc/molly-guard/rc` for more options.
